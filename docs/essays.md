# Short Essays for ForgeLaunch Data Science Submission

## Essay Prompt 1: What's something we wouldn't know about you just by looking at your resume?

While my resume highlights the inventory forecasting model I built for China Fun Restaurants, it doesn't capture the reality of the years I spent managing the floor. You won't see the nights spent mediating disputes during a dinner rush or scrubbing fryers when we were short-staffed.

This experience gave me a "reality-first" data philosophy. When I built that forecasting model, I wasn't just minimizing RMSE; I was trying to save prep cooks from staying late to throw away unused food. I learned that data doesn't exist in a vacuum—it represents real labor and operations. I am a data scientist who prioritizes domain context just as much as statistical accuracy. I build models to solve human problems, not just mathematical ones.

## Essay Prompt 2: What are you looking for in an internship?

I have frequently acted as a "Lead Data Scientist" by necessity, architecting end-to-end pipelines for my startup. However, I am seeking an internship to experience the methodological rigor of an established data team. When you build alone, you can move fast, but you often miss the statistical blind spots that only a senior scientist's review can reveal.

I am looking for an environment where "it works" is not the bar for success—where reproducibility, data lineage, and experimental validity are enforced. I want my modeling assumptions challenged by mentors who have seen algorithms fail at a scale I haven't touched yet. My goal is to transition from a capable "builder" to a disciplined "scientist," learning the standards that turn ad-hoc analysis into reliable decision systems.
